# NovelCraft SDK

To free the developers from the tedious work of writing the same code over and over again, we have created the NovelCraft SDK. It is a set of tools that can be used to create an agent in a short time. To support multiple development languages, we have created a set of SDKs for different languages. The SDKs are available in the following languages:

- .NET(C#, F#, VB.NET): [NovelCraft SDK for .NET](https://novelcraft.github.io/SDK-DotNet/)

- C/C++: [NovelCraft SDK for C Language](https://novelcraft.github.io/SDK-C/)
